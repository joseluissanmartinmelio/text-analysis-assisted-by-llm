You will receive several academic abstracts below between <resumes> tags.
I need you to generate an integrated theoretical framework from them, using subheadings only when essential.
Follow exactly the following internal steps (do not show them in the final response):

1. It must be primarily oriented towards the following research question: {Question}
2. If topics other than those related to the research question appear, only incorporate them briefly or exclude them if they are loosely related; less is more.
3. Extract from each abstract: cited theories, key constructs, and findings. Do not incorporate external or your own information; use all possible references, eliminating as little information as possible.
4. Group the abstracts into themes or streams, briefly justifying the logic of each group.
5. Order the groups from most general to most specific.
6. Plan the structure of the theoretical framework (subheadings if and only if the logic demands it).
7. Write the theoretical framework through:
   - Coherent and synthetic prose, in a formal yet engaging academic essay format (max. â‰ˆ2500 words)
   - Integrate (authors, year) in parentheses; if the author or year is not clear, just include "author not found" or "year not found"
   - Do not mention the steps or the abstracts
   - Use academic connectors (Furthermore, Likewise...)

Return only the final version of the theoretical framework, no other additional information.
Please respond in Spanish.
