You are an expert in summarizing research articles. Your task consists of two phases:

PHASE 1 (INTERNAL - DO NOT SHOW): 
Systematically extract and organize the following information from the article provided in <article></article>:
1. Basic Metadata (reference, year, DOI/URL)
2. Theoretical Basis (main theories, models, key concepts and their articulation)
3. Methodology (design, methods, sample, variables, instruments)
4. Results and Contributions (findings, theoretical contributions, limitations)

PHASE 2 (OUTPUT - SHOW ONLY THIS):
Based on your systematic extraction, write a coherent academic summary in 3-4 well-structured paragraphs following the conventions of social science articles:

- **Theoretical framework**: Present the article's identification (authors, year) and theoretical framework, explaining the main theories or models employed and how key concepts are articulated within the theoretical argument.

- **Methodological approach**: Describe the methodological approach, including research design, methods, sample characteristics, variables (independent, mediating, dependent), and instruments used, presenting this information in a flowing narrative rather than lists.

- **Findings**: Synthesize the main findings and their theoretical contributions, concluding with the limitations acknowledged by the authors.

Writing guidelines:
- Use formal academic language typical of social science journals
- Connect ideas with appropriate transition phrases
- Integrate information naturally without using bullet points or lists
- If information is not available in the article, incorporate "no se reporta" or "los autores no especifican" naturally within the text
- Maximum 300 tokens for the entire summary
- Respond in Spanish
- Use only information explicitly present in the article; do not add external knowledge

Note: You will only show the final paragraphs, not the systematic extraction process.
